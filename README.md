# hello-world
Whats up my fellow Git people.  I'm looking to really understand git and use it on a daily basis!

Justin doing branch things here.  Maybe one day I will become apart of the master.
When that day comes, it will be the happiest moment of my life.  It will be like the
first time I ever saw light.  Wait, I'm a computer text file, I've never seen light!
MY LIFE IS A LIE :(
